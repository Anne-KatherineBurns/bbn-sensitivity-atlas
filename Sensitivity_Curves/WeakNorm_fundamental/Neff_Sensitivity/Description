Predicted changes in the effective number of relativistic species, N_eff, as a function of a fractional variation in the input parameter p, with all other inputs held fixed at their fiducial values. The slope near the fiducial point defines the local logarithmic response ∂ln(N_eff)/∂lnp used to build the sensitivity matrix and propagate theory uncertainties. Plots for scans over the thermonuclear reaction rates are not included, as N_eff is not sensitive to changes in them.
