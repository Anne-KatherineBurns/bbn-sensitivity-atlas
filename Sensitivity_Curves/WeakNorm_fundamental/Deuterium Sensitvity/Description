Predicted changes in the primordial deuterium abundance, D/H, as a function of a fractional variation in the input parameter p, with all other inputs held fixed at their fiducial values. The slope near the fiducial point defines the local logarithmic response ∂ln(D/H)/∂lnp used to build the sensitivity matrix and propagate theory uncertainties.
